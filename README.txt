# ParkFinder

ParkFinder is a simple app that shows information about
5 city parks in the Kirkland, WA and Redmond, WA areas.
It was developed by Tige Williams as part of the 
Android for Beginners course on Udacity.

Special thanks to GDG Seattle Android for hosting the
developer sessions.  And for the doughnuts.  And pizza.
